FundaScraperSelf is a Python-based scraper developed to extract and structure dynamic listing data from Funda.nl. The project was designed to build a structured dataset of Amsterdam properties for tracking price movements and analyzing real estate market dynamics.
- As Funda regularly updates its website structure, certain elements of the scraper may require adjustments over time. I aim to keep the project updated when possible, and it remains a strong demonstration of my understanding of web automation and dynamic data extraction.
